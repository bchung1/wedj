# wedj
Wedj ("We DJ") is a web application that creates a collaborative music experience. It allows the public to decide what music they want to hear in a shared/public space. 

Status: 
- Requested tracks are succesfully added to spotify playlist; however, the playlist doesn't update dynamically. The page must be refreshed to see the new tracks, which of course stops the music... why spotify why :(
- Tracks are now persistent, used MongoDB as database instead of firebase
